      <div> <p>Web design refers to the design of websites. It usually refers to the user experience aspects of website
                  development rather than software development. Web design used to be focused on designing websites for
                  desktop browsers; however, since the mid-2010s, design for mobile and tablet browsers has become
                  ever-increasingly <br> Responsive Web Design (a.k.a. "Responsive" or "Responsive Design") is an
                  approach to
                  designing web content that appears regardless of the resolution governed by the device. Itâ€™s typically
                  accomplished with viewport breakpoints (resolution cut-offs for when content scales to that view). The
                  viewports should adjust logically on tablets, phones, and desktops of any resolution.
